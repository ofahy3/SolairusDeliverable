# Solairus Intelligence Report Generation - Style & Formatting Requirements

Use the following rules when generating the monthly Solairus Intelligence Report. These rules ensure the output matches the quality standards expected by the client and eliminates the need for manual analyst revision.

---

## 1. Section Header Formatting

**All major section headers must be bold:**
- **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- **ECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR BUSINESS AVIATION**

**Subsection titles must use Title Case:**
- **Taiwan Strait Escalation Risk**
- **Middle East Airspace Volatility**
- **European Regulatory and Economic Pressures**

---

## 2. Bottom Line Structure

The Bottom Line section must be:
1. **A single, unified paragraph** (not multiple separate paragraphs for different topics)
2. **Lead with the most critical assessment in bold**, ending the bold at a natural break (comma or period)
3. **Synthesize all three regional themes** (Taiwan/Asia, Middle East, Europe) into one cohesive statement
4. **Remove tangential topics** that are not directly relevant to the client's core operations

**Example structure:**
```
**Ergo assesses that a Taiwan Strait blockade would trigger immediate closure of Taiwan FIR and adjacent corridors,** forcing rapid rerouting of Northeast Asia-Southeast Asia and Asia-Australia traffic, while Middle East and European operations face persistent flight planning friction from tactical airspace adjustments and rising regulatory overhead.
```

**Avoid:**
- Multiple paragraphs covering unrelated topics
- Generic "high-end coercive scenario" language - be specific
- **Including any topic in the Bottom Line that is not expounded upon in a Key Findings section below.** The Bottom Line previews the report's content - every theme mentioned must have a corresponding section that develops it.

---

## 3. Key Findings Section Structure

Each Key Finding subsection must follow this pattern:

### Opening Paragraph
1. **Bold the lead assessment sentence** (the core analytical judgment)
2. **Remove "Ergo assesses that" or "Ergo judges" from the start of bolded sentences** - just bold the assessment itself
3. End the bold at a natural break point
4. After the opening analysis, include a **client-specific transition sentence** before bullets

**Example:**
```
**Sustained or increasing Chinese coercion against Taiwan remains the most probable near-term trajectory,** with blockade scenarios presenting the highest operational disruption risk. In the event of a full blockade, China would destroy ROC air force capabilities and establish multi-ring blockade operations, ceasing Taiwan Strait traffic entirely and forcing vessels and aircraft onto longer Pacific routes. Ergo assesses three implications for Solairus:
```

### Transition Sentences (Required)
Before each bullet list, include a client-specific transition:
- "Ergo assesses three implications for Solairus:"
- "Two trends Ergo is monitoring for Solairus:"

---

## 4. Bullet Point Formatting

**Use dash bullets, not blockquote bullets:**
- `-   **Route disruption.** Rerouting via Philippine Sea...`

**Each bullet must start with a bold lead phrase followed by a period:**
- **Route disruption.**
- **Cyber degradation.**
- **Escalation indicators.**
- **Israel operations.**
- **Houthi persistence.**
- **EU AI Act compliance overhead.**
- **Industrial recovery trajectory.**

**Punctuation within bullets:**
- Use periods to separate sentences, not semicolons

---

## 5. Remove Internal Scenario Names and Probabilities

Do NOT include internal Ergo scenario codenames or probability percentages in client-facing reports:

**Remove these patterns:**
- "Strait Jacket" scenario
- "Tinderboxed" scenario
- "Abraham Discords"
- "Fortress EU" scenario (55% probability as of 18 November 2025)

**Instead, describe the scenarios substantively:**
- "In the event of a full blockade..."
- "While unlikely, full-scale war could resume in the event of..."

---

## 6. Word Choice and Phrasing

**Preferred terminology:**
- "elevated security thresholds" (not "higher security thresholds")
- "ceasing Taiwan Strait traffic entirely" (not "causing Taiwan Strait traffic to cease entirely")
- "US-UK strikes have failed to eliminate" (not "prove resilient to US-UK strikes")
- "sustaining threats to" (not "maintaining threats to")

**Avoid verbose constructions:**
- "Ergo assesses that..." at the start of every section - vary the structure
- "blockade-type scenarios" - just say "blockade scenarios"

---

## 7. Economic Indicators Table

**Indicator names must include units:**
- Jet Fuel (USD/gal)
- Crude Oil (USD/bbl)

**Be specific with indicator names:**
- "Crude Oil" (specific commodity)
- NOT "Oil/Energy" (vague category)

---

## 8. Structural Coherence: Bottom Line <-> Key Findings

**The Bottom Line must only preview content that is developed in the Key Findings sections.**

Before including a topic in the Bottom Line, verify:
1. Does this topic have a dedicated Key Findings subsection?
2. Is that subsection substantive (opening paragraph + bullet points)?

If no -> exclude from Bottom Line.

---

## 9. Risk Framing and Probability Calibration

**This is a critical issue.** The script tends to overweight low-probability, high-impact scenarios and frame them as things operators should actively prepare for. This creates unnecessarily alarmist reports.

### Calibration Rules

**1. Lead with the most probable trajectory, not the worst case:**
- "Sustained or increasing Chinese coercion against Taiwan remains the most probable near-term trajectory"

**2. Explicitly flag low-probability scenarios as unlikely:**
- "While unlikely, full-scale war could resume in the event of..."
- "In the unlikely event of a full blockade..."

**3. Use contingency framing, not preparation imperatives:**
- "...would add significant flight time" (conditional consequence)
- NOT "Flight departments require pre-planned aircraft relocations" (implies imminent action needed)

**4. Reserve "prepare for" and "require" language for likely scenarios:**
- High-probability events: "Operators should plan for short-notice restrictions"
- Low-probability events: "In the event of X, operators would face Y"

### Probability Language Guide

| Ergo Assessment | Appropriate Framing |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Base case / most likely | "remains the most probable trajectory," "Ergo expects" |
| Plausible but not expected | "could occur if," "in the event of," "would result in" |
| Unlikely but possible | "While unlikely," "In the unlikely event," "remote but consequential" |
| Tail risk | "In an extreme scenario," "worst-case contingency" |

## 10. Content Focus Rules

**Include only operationally relevant content for the client:**
- The client is a business aviation operator
- Focus on: airspace access, route planning, fuel costs, regulatory compliance, client travel patterns
- Exclude: tangential policy topics, export controls (unless affecting aviation), detailed diplomatic analysis

---

## 11. Summary Checklist

Before finalizing the report, verify:

- [ ] All major section headers are bold
- [ ] Subsection titles use Title Case
- [ ] Bottom Line is a single unified paragraph with bold lead sentence
- [ ] **Every topic mentioned in the Bottom Line has a corresponding Key Findings section**
- [ ] Each Key Finding section has a bold lead assessment (without "Ergo assesses that" prefix)
- [ ] Client-specific transition sentences precede all bullet lists
- [ ] Bullets use dash format with bold lead phrases
- [ ] No internal scenario names or probability percentages appear
- [ ] Economic indicators include units (USD/gal, USD/bbl)
- [ ] No semicolons within bullet points - use periods instead
- [ ] All content is directly relevant to business aviation operations
- [ ] **Low-probability scenarios are explicitly flagged as unlikely** (not presented as baseline expectations)
- [ ] **"Prepare for" / "require" language is reserved for likely scenarios** (use conditional framing for tail risks)
